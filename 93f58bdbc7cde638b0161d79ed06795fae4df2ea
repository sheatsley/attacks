we've nearly cracked it -- disabling projection, clamping, and l2-norm in surface with the new tahn fixes (mapping out needs to consider machine eps as well), we finally surpass foolbox with an even lower norm. the key is to also consider additional iterations beyond 300: with these fixes, at 1000 iterations, we get 1.01% acc at 11.73 norm vs 1.06% at 12.87 norm (interestingly, just forgoing the l2 norm but keeping clamping and projection we win in mnist with 0.00 at 24.25 vs 0.13 at 24.07). the projection is likely the key here (as we observed during christmas that we never reach 100% of the budget consumption, even though we should have)
