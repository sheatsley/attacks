Is it over father? No student grinds forever, my son. We're passing all semantic tests for phishing (just re-ran) and mnist (ran a couple days ago). margins are tight, but we're ahead (made some changes to dlr so that should probably be retested, but it should only make our attack better...). most of the component performance tests for l2 and linf are passing (did not test l0); high bits: if youre using df smap, you basically have to set alpha to 1 (unless you have an adaptive learning rate thanks to adam), and linf with df does not like the closure method when using cwloss (need to confirm cwloss; if so, binary search and call it a day, else, need to think of getting rid of closure.. i hope its the former...)
