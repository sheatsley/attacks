fab implementation may require its own saliency map. with df, gets lower accuracy with (0.91%) with a bit higher norm (0.149) than other implementations. Working the exact projection logic in there does worse on both fronts without a proper alpha_max implementation. That logic is problematic since it is based on the original x. currently reworking to see what we can do wrt that second 'gradient'
