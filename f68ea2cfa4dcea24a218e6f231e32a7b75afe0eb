goodbye cov. also, all semantic tests *should* pass (spot running tests here and there shows we're within performance margins). Next step: remove cov from everywhere, transformation logic (no longer need to assume everything need be in 0-1 now?), and need to think about what to do for projection logic... (*necessary* for l2 attacks to ignore it, but probably necessary for l0 and linf attacks to keep it...)
