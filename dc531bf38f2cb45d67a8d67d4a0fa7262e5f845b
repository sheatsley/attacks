finally. all tests (that I care about) are passing. there's an attack or two that fails to get under 10% model acc, but their non-random-start counterparts just do fine... (I think to totaly fix this, we need to implement line 5 of the apgd algorithm that confirms the random start helped... we'll see). all performance tests are passing. all special tests are passing (sans an attack or two). identity tests fail but they're supposed to at this point.
